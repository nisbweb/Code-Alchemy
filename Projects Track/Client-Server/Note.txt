Hey! So, for this project, we're going to set up a client-server program.
 Weâ€™ll need to create both a server and a client. 
 The cool part is that the server will be able to handle multiple clients at the same time! 
 Its main job will be to receive messages from the clients and simply let them know that their messages have been received. 
 Give it a try , Hope it will be fun lesson of netwroks :) !!!
