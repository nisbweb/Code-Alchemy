/*
    A corrupted memory dump has been retrieved in big-endian format, but the system you're working with processes memory in little-endian format. 
    Your task is to convert an array of 32-bit hexadecimal values from big-endian to little-endian.

    Given an array of 32-bit hex values (in string format), convert each value from big-endian to little-endian.

    Input:
    An array/vector of 32-bit hexadecimal strings in big-endian format.

    Output:
    An array/vector of strings representing the corresponding values in little-endian format.

    Example
    Input
    memory_dump = ["0x12345678", "0xABCDEF01", "0x98765432"]

    Output
    ["0x78563412", "0x01EFCDAB", "0x32547698"]
