/*
    The malware is embedded in specific system files. You must determine the optimal sequence in which to remove these infected files to minimize system downtime. 
    Each file has dependencies, and you cannot remove a file before its dependent file is removed.

    Input Format:
    A list of files, where each file is represented as an object containing:
    - file_id: (integer) The unique identifier of the file.
    - dependencies: (array of integers) The file IDs this file depends on.

    Output Format:
    An array representing the optimal sequence of file removal.

    Example:
    Input
    [
        {"file_id": 1, "dependencies": []},
        {"file_id": 2, "dependencies": [1]},
        {"file_id": 3, "dependencies": [2]},
        {"file_id": 4, "dependencies": [1, 3]}
    ]

    Output
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
