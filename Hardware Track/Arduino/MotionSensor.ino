/*
    Security System with Motion Sensor
    Develop a basic security system using an Arduino and a motion sensor (PIR). When motion is detected, the system should trigger an alarm (a buzzer or an LED) 
    and send a notification via serial communication to indicate a breach.

    Input:
    Motion sensor detection (boolean: detected or not detected).

    Output:
    Alarm triggered (sound or light) and notification sent to the serial monitor.
