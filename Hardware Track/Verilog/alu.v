-- 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
-- Implement a 4-bit ALU in VHDL that can perform basic arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR. 
-- The ALU should take two 4-bit inputs (A and B) and a 3-bit operation code (Op) to determine the operation.

-- Inputs:
-- A, B: 4-bit binary numbers.
-- Op: 3-bit operation code.

-- Outputs:
-- Result: 4-bit output, result of the selected operation.
-- Carry: 1-bit carry-out for arithmetic operations.
