## Tracks

### Software Track
Can you fix a critical system? There’s a challenge ahead of you to dive into the heart of a malfunctioning computer and restore order before it's too late. Learn **core** computer science topics like OS, CN, and DBMS while solving exciting Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges. It's perfect for those who love exploring the inner workings of systems through code.Master key concepts and push the boundaries of your problem-solving abilities!

### Hardware Track
With the Hardware Track, you can explore the realm of embedded systems and electronics where code meets real hardware. This track is meant for anyone who enjoy applying code to hardware, whether they work with IoT, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or simply just play around with VHDL. 

### Puzzles Track
This track helps you level up your coding skills through fun and simple puzzles and math challenges. No prior experience? No problem! Start small and grow your problem-solving abilities while contributing to open-source.
